## About
For this excercise i focused on getting as close as posible to the design in the time frame. Implemented a mobile first approach changing the styles when reaching 600px width.

- This project was bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- The only additional dependency used was [`sass`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support)

Also I focused on getting good results in Accesibility, Best practices, SEO and performance when runing LightHouse report. Here is the report for the desktop version.

## Things to Improve

Some things I would've liked to do with more time.

- Separate content from the components.
- Make the form work.
- Add a favicon.
- Improve performance for mobile reported by LightHouse.
- Ask design for Futura font, hover state styles for buttons and form validation design examples.
- Find a better naming for css classes (I Don't have much experience using css modules).
- Add animations to bring more life ❤️
